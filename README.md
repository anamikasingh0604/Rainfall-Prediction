# Rainfall-Prediction
Data Source:

File: Rainfall.csv
Contents: Historical rainfall data, including information on date, location, and amount of rainfall.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Key Steps:

Data Loading:

Loaded the dataset using pandas with the command: df = pd.read_csv('Rainfall.csv').
Displayed the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure: df.head().
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing the rows/columns.
Converted data types as necessary .
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed statistical analysis to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
Created visualizations (e.g., line plots, bar charts) to observe trends and patterns in rainfall over time and across different regions.
Trend Analysis:

Analyzed seasonal and annual trends in rainfall.
Identified any significant changes or anomalies in the data.
Insights and Reporting:

Derived key insights from the data analysis, such as regions with the highest/lowest rainfall, seasonal patterns, and long-term trends.
Created a comprehensive report with visualizations and interpretations of the findings.
Skills Gained:

Proficiency in data manipulation using Pandas.
Experience with data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Ability to perform exploratory data analysis and derive meaningful insights from datasets.
Improved understanding of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
Applications:

The insights from this project can be used to inform agricultural planning, water resource management, and understanding climate change impacts.
